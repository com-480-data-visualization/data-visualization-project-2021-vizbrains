      <h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <br><br>
        Since the 1920s, music changed dramatically. The 20th century is actually described as the “age of musical diversity”. Nowadays the streaming platforms dominate the industry, and allow us to bring together all these musical works.
        <br><br>
        On this website, you will discover many aspects of this evolution through three distinct visualizations.
        <br><br>
        • The first one shows how the release date of a song affects its popularity. At the same time, it gives the opportunity to hear the most popular track of each year.
        <br>
        <br>
        • The second visualization compares different interesting features of the tracks between two distinct years.
        <br>
        <br>
        • The last one studies the popularity of main genres of music through time.
        <br>

    <div>
      <h2 class="title">Timeline</h2>
      <p>
        <br><br>
        What were the most popular songs throughout the years and how actually popular were they ? On the timeline below, we selected for each year the most popular song according to Spotify statistics.
        <br><br>
        Feel free to navigate on the timeline and listen to the samples.
        <br>
        • Scroll on the graph to zoom in or out. The more you zoom in, the more years will be visible.
        <br>
        • Navigate through the timeline with the horizontal scroll bar, or by dragging the cursor directly on the graph.

      <p>
        <br><br>
        Obviously, people on Spotify tend to listen to recent tracks, hence old songs appear as less popular than new ones.
        <br><br>
        According to you, what's the period of time that had the cooler popular tracks ?  To us it's obviously the 90's !

      <h2 class="title">Year Comparator</h2>
      <p>
        Was music happier in the 1950s or in the 2000s? Was it easier to find music to dance on in the 1930s or in the 1980s?
        In this next visualisation, you can find out exactly this!
        <br><br>
        Hover over the attribute names to get a short description of what they measure, and change the years dynamically using the 2 sliders below.
        <br><br>
        If needed, you can find more information on the features <a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#object-audiofeaturesobject">here</a>.
      </p>
      <div class="slider_container"></div>
      <svg id="year_comparator" viewBox="0 0 800 500" width="75%" height="100%"></svg>
      <p>
        It seems like music only get explicit very recently. Is that surprising to you?
        <br><br>
        Also, do you see how similar 1987 and 2008 look, even though there are 20 years apart?
        Perhaps by using all the features we could gather a better picture, but the graph would be more crowded.
        <br><br>
        Note that the feature values (here in %) are calculated as the mean over the top tracks in each year.

      <h2 class="title">Popular Genres</h2>
      <p>
        <br><br>
        What did the generation of our great grand parents listen to ? What about our parents and grand parents ? 
        What was the golden age of Jazz ? When did Hip Hop emerge ?
        <br><br>
        The following visualization allows to answer such questions by clearly depicting the evolution of musical tastes over the last century.
        <br><br>
        For instance, if we take a close look at what happens from 1955 to 1980, we can see that Jazz, R&B and Soul gradually give way to Rock and Pop. We can also see the emergence of Hip Hop in the 90's.
        <br><br>
        Choose whether you want the graph to be ordered or not by ticking the box.
        <br>
        Choose which year's genres you want to compare using the slider. This will display a nice musical-wave-like transition.
