As three real music enthusiasts, we've always wanted to learn more and
do some scientific research in the music domain. Accordingly, the
dataset we chose is a collection of music data from a Kaggle
competition[^1].

More precisely, the data consists of music features for about 600 000
tracks and 1.1 million artists from the Spotify streaming service,
spanning 100 years (from 1922 to 2021). The data are divided into 2 main
datasets:

-   **Tracks:** name, date of release, popularity, duration, energy,
    tempo...

-   **Artists:** name, followers, popularity, genres.

You can find out a lot more details about the features in our
`EDA.ipynb` notebook.
